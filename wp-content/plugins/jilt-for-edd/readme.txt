Increase sales in your Easy Digital Downloads store by connecting to Jilt â€” send automated and marketing emails that make you money.

== Description ==

Jilt is built from the ground up to help your store increase sales. This plugin connects Jilt to [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/) to bring powerful eCommerce emails to your store.

= Email all of your customers =

Jilt is ready for eCommerce out-of-the-box &ndash; no extra configuration needed to sync order, customer, and product data! Connect your store, and you'll be able to communicate with customers in minutes.

- Automatically email your customers based on their shopping behavior
- Replace your EDD transactional emails with upgraded versions from Jilt
- Send newsletter, announcement, or marketing emails on-demand to interested contacts

= Powerful segmentation =

Targeted communication improves engagement with your emails, and Jilt helps you target your emails with advanced segmentation rules. Use almost any piece of order or customer data to tailor your emails to your audience.

= A complete abandoned cart solution =

[Jilt abandoned cart recovery solution](https://jilt.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=cta-a-complete-abandoned-cart-solution&utm_campaign=jilt-for-edd-wordpress-plugin) helps your eCommerce store **recover lost revenue** due to cart abandonment. This plugin will track when carts are abandoned on your store and send that data to Jilt. You can then send recovery emails to encourage the customers who abandoned these carts to complete the purchase.

Jilt has already helped merchants generate **over $90,000,000** in additional revenue! You can set up as many automations and recovery emails as you'd like, and customize the text and design of every email sent.

= Customize beautiful emails in minutes =

Jilt lets you send emails automatically when events happen in your store. You can set up as many emails within a automation as you'd like (e.g., send 3 recovery emails per abandoned cart, or a series of 4 emails in a welcome automation).

You can also set up as many automations as you want &ndash; create a dedicated series of recovery emails for holidays, sales, or other company events. Build a complete set of lifecycle emails to communicate with customers from their first browsing experience through to repeat purchases.

Jilt's visual email builder helps you create emails that reflect your brand, and each automation includes relevant starter content to get your emails up and running as soon as possible.

= Send automated post-purchase follow ups =

Jilt's [post-purchase follow up emails](https://jilt.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=cta-send-automated-post-purchase-followups&utm_campaign=jilt-for-edd-wordpress-plugin) help you increase repeat sales. You've worked hard to gain new customers, so make the most of them! Send automated post-purchase emails once orders are completed to encourage leaving a review, providing feedback, or purchasing again.

You can also follow up over the long run. Win back inactive customers with replenishment and win-back email automations to increase lifetime value.

= Enhance your transactional emails =

Receipt emails are an amazing engagement opportunity, but EDD order emails are basic with limited personalization options. Jilt helps you completely replace your EDD order emails! Enhance your receipts and post-purchase notifications by using Jilt's visual email builder.

You can even leverage Jilt's advanced segmentation to send different versions of your order emails. Need to send different receipts for high value orders, or a different receipt for specific products? You can do it easily! Supercharge your transactional emails with Jilt.

= Built for site performance =

This plugin sends details on all orders and abandoned carts to the Jilt app rather than storing them in your site's database. This ensures that you can track data over time and get valuable insights into cart abandonment and recovery, while your site **stays speedy** and doesn't get bogged down with tons of abandoned cart data.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need anything else to use this plugin? =

Yes, a Jilt account (free) is required to recover abandoned carts for your Easy Digital Downloads store. You can [learn more about Jilt here](https://jilt.com/platforms/easy-digital-downloads/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=cta-faq&utm_campaign=jilt-for-edd-wordpress-plugin).

= What are all of the types of emails I can send? =

You can send almost any email you'd like with Jilt! Here's just a sampling of the types of emails you can enable:

- Newsletter, announcement, or marketing emails (broadcasts)
- Cart abandonment recovery
- Welcome new customers or first-time purchasers
- Thank your repeat purchasers or reward your VIP or high volume customers
- Win back your inactive customers or send them replenishment reminders
- Ask customers for product reviews after purchase, or send a follow up email series
- Replace your order emails with customized receipts, post-purchase notifications, refund notifications, and cancellation confirmations
- Send broadcast emails to your entire contact list to announce new products, sales, or offers

= When is a cart "abandoned"? =

A cart is considered abandoned if a customer has added items to the cart, but has not checked out or shown any cart activity for at least 15 minutes (i.e. adding more items). At this point, Jilt starts the timers for your recovery emails.

= Which customers will be emailed for abandoned carts? =

Any logged in customer who abandons a cart will receive recovery emails from Jilt. Any guest customer who has entered a full, valid email address in the checkout process will also be sent recovery emails.

= When will post-purchase emails be sent? =

The post purchase trigger is for order **completion**, as this tells us your store is "done" with the order. Once an order is marked "completed", Jilt will schedule post-purchase emails on the schedule you've configured in your campaign.

= Can I include unique discount codes in my recovery emails? =

Yes! Jilt can automatically create unique discount codes and include them in your recovery emails. This gives you a proven and powerful means of increasing conversion rates and recovering more orders!
