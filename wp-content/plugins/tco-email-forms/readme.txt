Creating custom optin forms has never been this easy (or fun)! Carefully craft every detail of your forms and subscribe users to a list.

== Description ==

Integration with companies like MailChimp are a big deal for our customers, so we wanted to create an experience that was both powerful and seamless when using X. Simply create forms in our plugin then connect those forms with your MailChimp list via their provided API key. Scroll to see cool ideas for presenting your MailChimp optin forms, and then run (don't walk) to purchase a copy of X.
