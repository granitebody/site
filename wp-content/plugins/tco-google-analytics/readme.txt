Simply drop in your Google Analytics code snippet, select where you'd like it to be output, and you're good to go! Google Analytics made easy.

== Description ==

Manage your Google Analytics from a dedicated space. Simply input your code snippet and select where you would like it to be output on your page (i.e. in your site's header or footer). This flexible output allows you to receive the reporting you prefer for more accurate statistics. Placement in the header will log all visits to your site, while placement in the footer records only those who have waited for a full page load.
